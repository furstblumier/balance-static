title: Saving The Dragoon
---
## <center>Overview</center>
Dragoon is a very static **melee dps** Job. You have strict, long combos to execute and timers within those combos that need to be maintained. Unlike other Jobs - especially other melee - which rely upon a priority system for their basic GCD rotation, Dragoon instead has static buttons to press in a specific order with very little variance. **Shadowbringers** brings with it a new reliance on hitting proper positionals to trigger new skills.

The bread-and-butter of your rotation, so to speak, these are the buttons you press most frequently. They're broken down into several **combo** chains with various effects and uses.
