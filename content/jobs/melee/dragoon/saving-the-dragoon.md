title: Saving The Dragoon
---
## <center>Overview</center>
Dragoon is a very static **melee dps** Job. You have strict, long combos to execute and timers within those combos that need to be maintained. Unlike other Jobs - especially other melee - which rely upon a priority system for their basic GCD rotation, Dragoon instead has static buttons to press in a specific order with very little variance. **Shadowbringers** brings with it a new reliance on hitting proper positionals to trigger new skills.

## <center>Resources</center>
- [Gear Comparison Tool](http://bit.ly/DRG-Gear-Accurate)\
Allows you to fill in your current [Level 80] gear and melds and figure out roughly which set will perform better.
- [Rotation Builder tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15hOfxLnmacJbY1FeNSxX6R4owTzChRD45wVcvT3zZeI/edit#gid=1421417811)\
Allows you to input stats (either your character’s stats or ones made with the above Gear tool) and then build a rotation with them to get a more accurate readout of your DPS. You can use this tool to compare multiple rotations with the same gear to see which one outputs more. This tool causes some substantial load, so be cautious when using.
- [Controller Guide](http://bit.ly/DRG-Controller)\
A simple guide to setting up your controller to play this Job. Old setups are listed within, but I’ll be working soon to get updated ones in there!
- [Tethercalc](https://tethercalc.herokuapp.com/) by Platinum Xephera on Ultros\
An incredibly useful tool that you can use to see which member of your party is the proper tether target. You just inject your fflogs link to the fight in question and it’ll tell you who you tethered and show you who was the best target.

## <center>Global Cooldown (GCD) Actions</center>
The bread-and-butter of your rotation, so to speak, these are the buttons you press most frequently. They're broken down into several **combo** chains with various effects and uses.
### <center>The Chaos Thrust Combo</center>
<center><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229111156746.png?v=1" alt="True Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228485943297.png?v=1" alt="Disembowel"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228259713024.png?v=" alt="Chaos Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229027139587.png?v=1" alt="Wheeling Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228683075584.png?v=1" alt="Fang and Claw"></center>

This combo has our basic damage buff in **Disembowel** alongside our damage-over-time skill, **Chaos Thrust**. These two effects are essential to dishing out proper amounts of damage.

### <center>The Full Thrust Combo</center>
<center><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229111156746.png?v=1" alt="True Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229073145877.png?v=1" alt="Vorpal Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228649652235.png?v=1" alt="Full Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228683075584.png?v=1" alt="Fang and Claw"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229027139587.png?v=1" alt="Wheeling Thrust"></center>

This combo uses our strongest weaponskill, **Full Thrust**, and that’s about it. It’s essentially just a filler combo whenever the aforementioned effects are active.

### <center>Raiden Thrust</center>
<center><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/600745843791888384.png?v=1" alt="Raiden Thrust"></center>

This action functions as a direct upgrade to **True Thrust** after you’ve successfully completed one of the above combos. If you land your proper positional on the **final/fifth hit**, **True Thrust** upgrades to **Raiden Thrust**!

### <center>The Coerthan Torment Combo</center>
<center><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/600746462002937866.png?v=1" alt="Doom Spike"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/600746461688496149.png?v=1" alt="Sonic Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/600745844248936515.png?v=1" alt="Coerthan Torment"></center>

Our new and freshly upgraded area-of-effect combo now packs **Coerthan Torment** as a third hit finisher! This is primarily used when dealing with a group of enemies numbering **3** or more.

### <center>Basic Rotation</center>
<center><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/600745843791888384.png?v=1" alt="Raiden Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228485943297.png?v=1" alt="Disembowel"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228259713024.png?v=" alt="Chaos Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229027139587.png?v=1" alt="Wheeling Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228683075584.png?v=1" alt="Fang and Claw"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/600745843791888384.png?v=1" alt="Raiden Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229073145877.png?v=1" alt="Vorpal Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228649652235.png?v=1" alt="Full Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228683075584.png?v=1" alt="Fang and Claw"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229027139587.png?v=1" alt="Wheeling Thrust"></center>

Putting all of this together with the timers, we come out with one single string of actions. In general, under normal circumstances, we want to maintain this sequence of GCDs for as long as we are capable!

### <center>The Other Guy</center>
Currently not used. You are safe to unmap it from your bar. With us having two 5-hit combo chains and this button breaking either combo at any stage and the longer runoff for combo maintenance, there is almost no way that this skill will ever find use. If it does, this section will add those niche cases.
***
## <center>Positionals</center>
Several actions in the kit deal more damage from the **Side** of a boss, and several deal more from the **Rear**. You want to be sure to set up to hit these for extra damage whenever possible.

### How do I know if I'm at the **Side** or **Rear** of a target?
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1kWTX9G.png" alt="Positionals" style="float:left;">
<br>

The arrow at the top is the **Front** of the target. You get no special bonuses by attacking here, other than lots of bonus deaths for standing in tank busters and cleaves.

On the left and right, you will find the **Sides** of the target. They account for 90o of the target on either side, but you will generally want to stand near the base of the visible line.

At the bottom of the image, there’s a gap between the two **Sides** of the target. This empty space is the **Rear**. When standing at the base of one **Side**, it becomes easy to decipher between the two positions - you either attack the empty space, or the line.

<br>

Some enemies will have the **Side** mark wrapping their entire hitbox, with no arrow to indicate a **Front**. These target rings are special, in that you will get positional bonuses from every action without needing to worry about where you attack from. All the enemies in the Palace of the Dead, for example, have this special targeting ring.
