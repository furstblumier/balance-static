title: Saving The Dragoon
---
## <div style="text-align:center">Overview</div>
Dragoon is a very static **melee dps** Job. You have strict, long combos to execute and timers within those combos that need to be maintained. Unlike other Jobs - especially other melee - which rely upon a priority system for their basic GCD rotation, Dragoon instead has static buttons to press in a specific order with very little variance. **Shadowbringers** brings with it a new reliance on hitting proper positionals to trigger new skills.

- [Gear Comparison Tool](http://bit.ly/DRG-Gear-Accurate)\
Allows you to fill in your current [Level 80] gear and melds and figure out roughly which set will perform better.
- [Rotation Builder tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15hOfxLnmacJbY1FeNSxX6R4owTzChRD45wVcvT3zZeI/edit#gid=1421417811)\
Allows you to input stats (either your character’s stats or ones made with the above Gear tool) and then build a rotation with them to get a more accurate readout of your DPS. You can use this tool to compare multiple rotations with the same gear to see which one outputs more. This tool causes some substantial load, so be cautious when using.
- [Controller Guide](http://bit.ly/DRG-Controller)\
A simple guide to setting up your controller to play this Job. Old setups are listed within, but I’ll be working soon to get updated ones in there!
- [Tethercalc](https://tethercalc.herokuapp.com/) by Platinum Xephera on Ultros\
An incredibly useful tool that you can use to see which member of your party is the proper tether target. You just inject your fflogs link to the fight in question and it’ll tell you who you tethered and show you who was the best target.

## <div style="text-align:center">Global Cooldown (GCD) Actions</div>
The bread-and-butter of your rotation, so to speak, these are the buttons you press most frequently. They're broken down into several **combo** chains with various effects and uses.


### <div style="text-align:center">The Chaos Thrust Combo</div>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229111156746.png?v=1" alt="True Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228485943297.png?v=1" alt="Disembowel"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228259713024.png?v=" alt="Chaos Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229027139587.png?v=1" alt="Wheeling Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228683075584.png?v=1" alt="Fang and Claw"></div>

This combo has our basic damage buff in **Disembowel** alongside our damage-over-time skill, **Chaos Thrust**. These two effects are essential to dishing out proper amounts of damage.



### <div style="text-align:center">The Full Thrust Combo</div>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229111156746.png?v=1" alt="True Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229073145877.png?v=1" alt="Vorpal Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228649652235.png?v=1" alt="Full Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228683075584.png?v=1" alt="Fang and Claw"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229027139587.png?v=1" alt="Wheeling Thrust"></div>

This combo uses our strongest weaponskill, **Full Thrust**, and that’s about it. It’s essentially just a filler combo whenever the aforementioned effects are active.

### <div style="text-align:center">Raiden Thrust</div>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/600745843791888384.png?v=1" alt="Raiden Thrust"></div>

This action functions as a direct upgrade to **True Thrust** after you’ve successfully completed one of the above combos. If you land your proper positional on the **final/fifth hit**, **True Thrust** upgrades to **Raiden Thrust**!

### <div style="text-align:center">The Coerthan Torment Combo</div>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/600746462002937866.png?v=1" alt="Doom Spike"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/600746461688496149.png?v=1" alt="Sonic Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/600745844248936515.png?v=1" alt="Coerthan Torment"></div>

Our new and freshly upgraded area-of-effect combo now packs **Coerthan Torment** as a third hit finisher! This is primarily used when dealing with a group of enemies numbering **3** or more.



### <div style="text-align:center">Basic Rotation</div>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/600745843791888384.png?v=1" alt="Raiden Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228485943297.png?v=1" alt="Disembowel"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228259713024.png?v=" alt="Chaos Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229027139587.png?v=1" alt="Wheeling Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228683075584.png?v=1" alt="Fang and Claw"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/600745843791888384.png?v=1" alt="Raiden Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229073145877.png?v=1" alt="Vorpal Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228649652235.png?v=1" alt="Full Thrust"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228683075584.png?v=1" alt="Fang and Claw"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229027139587.png?v=1" alt="Wheeling Thrust"></div>

Putting all of this together with the timers, we come out with one single string of actions. In general, under normal circumstances, we want to maintain this sequence of GCDs for as long as we are capable!



### <div style="text-align:center">The Other Guy</div>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VzHAlvT.png" alt="Piercing Talon"></div>

Currently not used. You are safe to unmap it from your bar. With us having two 5-hit combo chains and this button breaking either combo at any stage and the longer runoff for combo maintenance, there is almost no way that this skill will ever find use. If it does, this section will add those niche cases.

***


## <div style="text-align:center">Positionals</div>
Several actions in the kit deal more damage from the **Side** of a boss, and several deal more from the **Rear**. You want to be sure to set up to hit these for extra damage whenever possible.



### How do I know if I'm at the **Side** or **Rear** of a target?
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1kWTX9G.png" alt="Positionals" style="float:left;">
<br>

The arrow at the top is the **Front** of the target. You get no special bonuses by attacking here, other than lots of bonus deaths for standing in tank busters and cleaves.

On the left and right, you will find the **Sides** of the target. They account for 90o of the target on either side, but you will generally want to stand near the base of the visible line.

At the bottom of the image, there’s a gap between the two **Sides** of the target. This empty space is the **Rear**. When standing at the base of one **Side**, it becomes easy to decipher between the two positions - you either attack the empty space, or the line.

<br>

Some enemies will have the **Side** mark wrapping their entire hitbox, with no arrow to indicate a **Front**. These target rings are special, in that you will get positional bonuses from every action without needing to worry about where you attack from. All the enemies in the Palace of the Dead, for example, have this special targeting ring.



### Side Positionals

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228683075584.png?v=1" alt="Fang and Claw" align = "center"> **Fang and Claw** deals 40 more potency from the **Side**.




### Rear Positionals


<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787228259713024.png?v=" alt="Chaos Thrust" align = "center"> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/354787229027139587.png?v=1" alt="Wheeling Thrust" align = "center"> **Chaos Thrust** and **Wheeling Thrust** deal 40 more potency from the **Rear**.



### Positional Parity
The DPS disparity between landing every single positional and **missing** every single positional is approximately 4%. Meaning, if you would do 10,000 dps while hitting every positional, then you would only deal 9,600 if you missed every single one.

In other words: You should *always* strive to land *every* positional in any situation where it is easy to do so, however, there is a priority system to what you should be focused on while learning to optimize a fight.

1. **Handle Mechanics**\
If you fail a mechanic, you lose the fight, so it doesn’t matter how much DPS you gain if it causes you to miss a mechanic.
2. **Stay Alive**\
Dodge death puddles, avoid standing in boss cleaves, etc. Don’t die for DPS, because a death has a negative impact you won’t overcome by keeping uptime up until you died.
Maintain Uptime
3. **ABC** - **A**lways **B**e **C**asting.\  
If your GCD stops spinning, you messed up. Assuming you are handling 1 and 2 properly, focus on keeping your rotation flowing and your GCD staying in constant motion.
4. **Land Positionals**\
Never let your GCD stop spinning in order to make it to a position for your flank or rear positionals - this helps no one and costs you DPS. Focus on landing positionals only after you have mastered the first three steps. Some fights and some strategies will require you to eschew positionals to handle mechanics, stay alive, or maintain uptime.  
This is **okay.**\
**It is not the end of the world if your group stacks on the face of the boss.
The DPS loss is not worth causing wipes over.**

## <div style="text-align:center">Off-GCD Actions</div>
These actions have individual recast timers, allowing you to so-called “weave” them in-between your GCDs.



### Dragon Spaghetti
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xnjzK8F.png" alt="Dragon Gauge"></div>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/R4fIFZB.png" alt="Blood of the Dragon" height="50px" style="float:left;"> **Blood of the Dragon** is our primary mechanic.\
Under normal circumstances, it should never fall off.








<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NDJ4MMl.png" alt="Mirage Dive" height="50px" style="float:left;"> **Mirage Dive** helps us gain **Dragon Eyes** to build toward **Life of the Dragon**.\
**Eyes** only open when **Blood of the Dragon** or **Life of the Dragon** is active.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BpzXsQ6.png" alt="Geirskogul" height="50px" style="float:left;"> **Geirskogul** can only be used under **Blood of the Dragon**, and when you press it with\
 **2 Dragon Eyes** open, we enter **Life of the Dragon**.



<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3E0WdH9.png" alt="Life of the Dragon"></div>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qRb6NSR.png" alt="Nastrond" height="50px" style="float:left;"> Under **Life of the Dragon**, **Geirskogul** becomes **Nastrond**.\
Ideally, you want to press **3 Nastrond** before your **Life** timer runs out.\
When the **Life** timer hits 0, you return to **Blood** with 30 seconds remaining.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FOsFhJn.png" alt="Stardiver" height="50px" style="float:left;"> Additionally, we can utilize **Stardiver** while under the effects of **Life of the Dragon**.\
We will always use exactly **1 Stardiver** in each sequence.
