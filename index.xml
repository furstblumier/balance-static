All openers assume there is a pull countdown and the boss is pulled at 0. If your group pulls earlier, adjust them as necessary. Use the highest tier Tincture / Infusion / Potion of Intelligence available.
With all openers being very close in estimated output over the course of the entire encounter, it is instead recommended to choose your opener based on your current spellspeed, with consideration towards potential fight-specific requirements.</description></item><item><title>Summoner Stat Priority</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/summoner/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 04:33:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/summoner/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Summoner Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/summoner/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 04:29:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/summoner/best-in-slot/</guid><description/></item><item><title>White Mage Leveling Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 03:45:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/leveling-guide/</guid><description>The Walter White Mage Leveling Guide Written by Eva Izunia (Goblin) Leveling White Mage allows you access to some of the smoothest dungeon runs in the game, due to the supremely high damage output when crowd controlling enemy groups and the nature of the job in general.

Q: Are there any Shukuchi macros?
A: Yes, the main ones use either to go to your target at the time, or use &amp;lt;1&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;2&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;3&amp;gt;, etc to go to specific party members.
Q: Why does our BiS not follow the stat priority?
A: Because of stat tiering and how it works together with our rotation, our rotation simulation brought out this exact combination of materia to be a higher average DPS value than fully following our stat priority.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Openers</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/ninja/openers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 03:09:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/ninja/openers/</guid><description>Why is there a Doton in my opener?

How does Raiden Thrust work?
Raiden Thrust is an upgraded True Thrust. It combos into both Disembowel and Vorpal Thrust and replaces True Thrust on your bar when it’s ready. You activate it by successfully landing the positional on the fifth hit of your combo (Fang and Claw or Wheeling Thrust following Wheeling Thrust or Fang and Claw, respectively).</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Openers</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/openers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 02:55:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/openers/</guid><description>Dragoon Opener and Rotation The primary use of the Opener is to prepare your cooldown alignment for the rest of the encounter. With our new job design, it’s possible that we’ll actually have fight-specific openers down the stretch, and they’ll all be added here!
These openers have not been too thoroughly tested as of yet, so please take them with a grain of salt, and if you discover anything that flies counter to what we have listed here, please don’t hesitate to ask!</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 02:55:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/skills-overview/</guid><description>Dragoon Skills Overview Global Cooldown Actions (Single Target) Icon Name Acronym Description True Thrust TT Basic combo initiator for both the Chaos Thrust and the Full Thrust combo with 290 potency.

You have strict, long combos to execute and timers within those combos that need to be maintained. Unlike other Jobs - especially other melee - which rely upon a priority system for their basic GCD rotation, Dragoon instead has static buttons to press in a specific order with very little variance. Shadowbringers brings with it a new reliance on hitting proper positionals to trigger new skills.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Leveling Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 02:47:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</guid><description>The basic single target rotation changes as you progress through the levels.
The general idea is to keep the Disembowel buff up and using the Full Thrust combo as a filler.
The Area of Effect (AoE) rotation, Doom Spike &amp;gt; Sonic Thrust &amp;gt; Coerthan Torment, becomes worth it at three targets. You still want to keep Disembowel up when using this rotation.
Off-Global Cooldown actions such as Jump or Geirskogul, as well as buffs like Lance Charge, should be used on cooldown on all levels.</description></item><item><title>Monk Stat Priority</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/monk/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 03:55:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/monk/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Monk Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/monk/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 03:54:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/melee/monk/best-in-slot/</guid><description>What do I meld on gear generally?

As purely the best option, yup, go back to 1:1 Twin Snakes and True.
What&amp;rsquo;s with the double Dragon Kick in the openers?
With Standard, you DK after Perfect Balance for DK&amp;rsquo;s higher potency and again later to gain Leaden finally.

The single most likely reason is that you aren’t weaving Blood Weapon late into the GCD. As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be very consistent. With high latency (100+ ms), double weaves can cause the last GCD to fall out of Blood Weapon.</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:44:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Dark Knight Best In Slot Day one prog set(s) will be listed immediately when a new tier is released, but pre-BiS sets will otherwise not be maintained on this page.

Its rotation features large bursts of damage, accompanied by spikes in actions per minute (APM) and requires managing both MP and a Blood Gauge, putting many hard-hitting attacks into party raid buff windows. It also has access to one of the most powerful single-target mitigation abilities available in The Blackest Night (TBN).</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight Leveling Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:23:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Introduction First off, a word of warning: Do not use the gear given out by the first job quest. It is normal-quality, meaning it is significantly weaker than other gear of the same item level. The Steel Cuirass (ilvl30), for example, has about the same defense as a high-quality Iron Scale Mail (ilvl 23).

Circle of Scorn is used before Fight or Flight in most openers and kept on cooldown in most phases for two reasons:
Its short cooldown (25 seconds) is equal to the duration of Fight or Flight, meaning one CoS usage should always occur during FoF regardless of their respective timings, given full uptime. Its high DoT uptime (~60%) means that any delays are likely to cost ticks at the end of the phase, resulting in a potency loss overall.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Stat Priority</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:35:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Paladin Advanced Guide</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:32:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/advanced-guide/</guid><description>This section assumes that you are comfortable with the entirety of the Paladin kit, as well as the basic rotation outlined in the Intro &amp;amp; Rotation Guide.

Introduction to Paladin Optimization Because Paladin&amp;rsquo;s self-buffs (Fight or Flight and Requiescat) are very powerful compared to raid buffs (e.g. Trick Attack, Divination), much of Paladin optimization focuses around maximizing usages of personal buff windows within a given phase or killtime, sometimes at the cost of raid buff contribution.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Openers</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:29:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</guid><description>Paladin Opener and Rotation Tanks currently use Grade 4 Tinctures of Strength (Strength also affects tank magic potency, including healing)
Quick Opener/Rotation Graphic: Alternative In-Depth Graphic: 60 Second Rotation Paladin&amp;rsquo;s natural rotation is approximately 63 seconds long, which means Fight or Flight and Requiescat (both with 60-second cooldowns) are delayed by 1 GCD per minute. In some situations this can cost FoF GCDs or even a Confiteor usage before the end of a phase, and in long encounters with minimal downtime, physical oGCDs must eventually be delayed as well to stay lined up with FoF.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:27:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</guid><description>Buffs Iron Will Toggle | 10s cooldown after toggling on. | No cooldown for toggling off.

White Mage (WHM) is one of the least mobile jobs in the game, and so planning movement is critical to success.

Pre-position with slidecasts and natural Dia refreshes Natural Dia refresh (&amp;lt; ~3s remaining), slidecast, or Swiftcast + Glare (not clipped, always consider holding for raise in prog) Rapture that does useful healing, Misery Regen that does necessary healing (rare in Savage and below) Overheal Lilies Dia outside natural refresh (almost always avoidable) Extended movements involve a combination of these roughly in order of priority, and a lot of movement can be minimized with proper prepositioning utilizing a combination of Dia and slidecasting.</description></item><item><title>White Mage Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 00:17:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Scholar Openers</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/openers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 00:13:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/scholar/openers/</guid><description>Scholar’s kit has a few select tools whose usage dictates how the rest of the opener operates: namely Dissipation and Chain Stratagem.

So we&amp;rsquo;re here, finally with a proper writeup.
Making BiS was expected to be very difficult this tier with AST&amp;rsquo;s new affinity for SpS&amp;hellip;but instead it actually was quite easy. Avoid Piety like the plague and there you go, there&amp;rsquo;s your BiS pieces.

Diurnal remains generally very efficient, but buffs to Celestial Opposition and Celestial Intersection reduce the reliance on GCD healing (which is where Nocturnal Sect primarily falls short of Diurnal), and Nocturnal Intersection is very strong.

Any premade Astrologian opener is a generic framework, not a universally optimal opener.
We&amp;rsquo;ve taken a lot of care to evaluate as many of the variables as we reasonably can and identify the core methodology of the most statistically successful opener with regard to when most DPS jobs burst the hardest and when other raid buffs should be coming out, assuming everyone is doing a proper opener.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:48:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</guid><description>Actions Icon Action Level Type MP Casting Recast Description Malefic 1 Spell 400 1.5s 2.5s Deals unaspected damage with a potency of 150.

RS Alignment Choice After the opener (i.e. starting from the second RS), you can elect to either align RS with the beginning of WM or the end. The tradeoff is that WM tends to have back-loaded damage, but Army’s Muse makes it easier to deal nine GCDs under RS.
Aligning RS with the beginning of WM is the easiest choice, but is slightly worse for damage.</description></item><item><title>Bard FAQ</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/bard/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 02:31:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/bard/faq/</guid><description>Single target FAQ When should I use Raging Strikes after the opener?
A couple of GCDs into Minuet. This is to cover as much Pitch Perfect potential as possible.
When do I use my second/third potion?
Try to cover Raging Strikes and Barrage with it. That damage spike is bigger than any heap of party buffs. If you can, also try to pop it right before an Iron Jaws, so that you can IJ at the end and get two runs of buffed DoTs.</description></item><item><title>Bard Openers</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/bard/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 02:30:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/ranged/bard/openers/</guid><description>Bard Openers For all openers;
Use Pitch Perfect at three stacks as able, and Refulgent procs as you get them. Hold Barrage until the next GCD if you already have an Refulgent proc. The best potion is high-quality Grade 4 Tincture of Dexterity.

Foreword Hi all! Welcome to our Bard guide, freshly revamped for the 5.x Shadowbringers expansion. This guide will cover concepts of Bard gameplay, from the very fundamentals to the limits of optimization, as well as serving as a pocket reference for all aspects of Bard.

Purpose and Introduction The purpose of this guide is to be a comprehensive gameplay guide for how to play and optimize the DNC rotation. This guide goes over the fundamentals and job basics while also looking into advanced tips and tricks that experienced players may not know. Due to the randomness of procs, Feathers, and Esprit generation, DNC has a dynamic playstyle where no two pulls are ever the same.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage Stat Priority</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 02:02:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Black Mage Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:58:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/best-in-slot/</guid><description>BiS: &amp;ldquo;Speed 3655 SpS Tier (Relic)&amp;quot;:

Get abilities on cooldown as soon as possible. This keeps us from sitting on skills that are ready which could potentially cause lost usages. Get strong abilities under raid buffs. This helps to maximize damage done. More damage is always better, especially when it&amp;rsquo;s free! Set up our rotation for the rest of the fight (or until a transition/extended period of downtime).</description></item><item><title>Gunbreaker Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 21:30:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/skills-overview/</guid><description>Gunbreaker Skills Overview Offensive On Global Cool Down Abilities Keen Edge The first skill of our basic combo. 200 potency.

It features high damage output and high casts-per-minute. GNB also features a strong defensive kit that, when used properly, can bring a lot of mitigation to the table. Let’s get started with a brief overview of the skills and abilities available to GNB.

Even though GNB starts at level 60, sometimes you may be Level Synced to below 60.
No Mercy is unlocked at level 2, so you will have it available for any content. While in combat, you should always use No Mercy on cooldown.
