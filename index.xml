The short answer is that our gear absolutely sucks for 2.41 this tier. We either have to take on a bunch of piety or use crafted gear, and neither one is efficient. 2.32 GCD lines up AF well, but sits on a sort of halfway point of DoT timings that requires us to alternate between 12 GCD and 13 GCD Bios, which can result in lost Bio ticks.</description></item><item><title>Sage Skills</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 19:59:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/skills-overview/</guid><description>Before you Start: Eukrasia First, a note about skills with &amp;ldquo;Eukrasian&amp;rdquo; in the name - these are upgraded versions of other skills that you would access by using the &amp;ldquo;Eukrasia&amp;rdquo; skill first. For example, to cast Eukrasian Dosis, first cast Eukrasia, then cast Dosis. Eukrasia itself is a 1-second instant-cast GCD, and the buffed ability will become a 1.5-second instant-cast GCD. Neither of these cast times are affected by spell speed, so any Eukrasian GCD will always be 2.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 09:50:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Written by Reina Kousaka of Leviathan Last updated: Feb 13 2022

Hello. I am Reina, a caster player, and I am standing on the shoulders of giants. This document aims to provide a comprehensive guide on advanced non-standard playstyle (also known as the AI rotation). There is the assumption you know all of the basics of BLM, including abbreviations and fundamentals.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 09:49:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/faq/</guid><description>Q: What is Umbral Soul used for? A: Purely a downtime tool, a better version of Transpose. Lets you build back up to Umbral Ice III + Three Umbral Hearts during downtime, so you can Thunder III -&amp;gt; Fire III when you can hit something again. If you end a fight in Astral Fire, Transpose into UI so you can use Umbral Soul. Do not use Umbral Soul during uptime.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 09:48:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/openers/</guid><description>Openers Openers should put abilities on cooldown, fit strong spells within buff windows, and minimize clipping. All openers assume there is a pull countdown and the boss is pulled at zero. If your group pulls earlier, adjust them as necessary. Use the highest tier Tincture / Infusion / Potion of Intelligence available.
With all openers being very close in estimated output over the course of the entire encounter, it is instead recommended to choose your opener based on your current spell speed, with consideration towards potential fight-specific requirements.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 09:48:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/skills-overview/</guid><description>Actions Icon Action Level Type MP Casting Recast Description Blizzard 1 Spell 400 2.5s 2.5s Deals ice damage with a potency of 180.

Job Overview Black Mage is a caster specializing in high, steady personal damage in place of providing party buffs. The job maintains a cyclical flow of expending MP via long, powerful casts in Astral Fire then swapping to refresh MP in Umbral Ice. While the rotation itself is somewhat simple, utilizing its movement tools and the flexibility built into its rotation to their fullest is key to maintaining uptime and maximizing damage as a Black Mage.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 09:46:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Single Target Leveling Rotation Sub Level 35 Fire I (F1) spam &amp;gt; Transpose &amp;gt; Blizzard I (B1) until max MP &amp;gt; Transpose &amp;gt; repeat

This will cover enough ground to get you started with AST, being able to handle this relatively high-input job in content at level 90. It is intended to be well-suited for any player, and if you take the advice and techniques from this guide you should be able to handle yourself well-enough in endgame content.
As this guide is relatively basic and does not go into any of the complexities of Astrologian, there will, of course, be gaps of knowledge, and some aspects of this fairly high-intensity job will be glossed over.</description></item><item><title>Red Mage Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:23:00

will need to Level from level 60 to level 90 if forgoing a jump book. So, it’s important to keep on top of GNB, especially at Level 70 due to sync for The Weapon’s Refrain (Ultimate) and The Unending Coil of Bahamut (Ultimate).
No Mercy is unlocked at level 2, so it’s used in all forms of content from the beginning of A Realm Reborn up to current content in Endwalker.</description></item><item><title>Scholar Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 23:56:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/basic-guide/</guid><description>This guide is intended for players who are looking to play Scholar in level 90 trials and raids. For information about playing Scholar while leveling, please see our Leveling Guide.
Quick Glossary SCH: Scholar CD (Cooldown): The time it takes before you’re able to cast an action again. GCD (Global Cooldown): Spells that share the same base recast time.

You can weave one oGCD after it without clipping. Do not use Ruin II for weaving. New skills: Protraction and Expedient Shields apply at the slidecast window. It is now possible to cast Adloquium and immediately use Deployment Tactics, but this is still not recommended because this will clip GCD.

With Boxer’s permission, I’m updating this guide for Endwalker. 6.0 doesn’t change a whole lot about the fundamentals of playing Samurai or melee, but this guide is still intended for newer players.</description></item><item><title>Dancer Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 23:53:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/advanced-guide/</guid><description>by Io Whitespirit (Faerie)
FOREWORD
One of the biggest requests I have had is a more concise document on what people “need to know” before jumping into more difficult content. This is not meant to be a replacement for a general guide to Dancer; please see Ringabel’s extensive write-up instead, which will be linked at the end of the document in the appendix.
This guide will be broken down into three sections: Basics, Intermediate, and Advanced.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 23:36:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/basic-guide/</guid><description>Saving The Dragoon Overview Dragoon is a relatively static melee DPS job with a high focus on weaving off-GCD actions in-between a rigid 10-hit sequence of GCD actions. Burst windows can get hectic, and prioritizing the various skills you need to execute can become a rather significant hassle in some instances. Endwalker has doubled down on this by introducing the ability to utilize yet more off-GCD actions at regular intervals, as if we didn’t have enough already.</description></item><item><title>Summoner Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 03:25:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/basic-guide/</guid><description>Introduction This guide will cover Summoner changes, rotations and ability usage in the Endwalker expansion. The core foundation of Summoner has changed significantly, most notably with the complete removal of damage over time abilities (dots) and the newly added primal arcanum system (gems). The basic flow and idea of Summoner’s rotation can be simplified as follows:
Use Searing Light in alignment with party raid buffs Summon Bahamut and use all abilities to refresh your primal gems Go through three primal phases Summon Phoenix and use all abilities to refresh your primal gems Go through three primal phases Repeat Within that framework, there is additional nuance such as optimizing damage into raid buffs, moving certain spells around based on movement requirements, and making effective use of Summoner’s various utility tools.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 23:24:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</guid><description>Notable Endwalker Changes New Skills: Astrodyne, Macrocosmos, Exaltation, Minor Arcana.

Overview Ninja is a fast-paced yet flexible job with a high focus on a powerful burst every one and two minutes. It is unique from other jobs with its utilization of Ninjutsus, a combo-like system allowing a Ninja to form a multitude of ranged attacks. It also has one of the most frequent raid buffs (Trick Attack) where we emphasize landing all our biggest attacks within 15.</description></item><item><title>Red Mage Fight Tips</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 04:24:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/fight-tips/</guid><description>Red Mage Asphodelos Encounter Advice For information on Addle and Magick Barrier usage, see https://bit.ly/3AHEMxZ
P1S Intemperance Embolden should be used on cooldown, with the two-minute and six-minute buff windows occurring during Intemperance.

I&amp;rsquo;ll try to cover some of the areas that aren&amp;rsquo;t covered in the basic guide.
Phlegma Timings With the rework of Trick Attack in 6.1, it is no longer necessary to worry about odd-minute buff windows, as they no longer exist. Rather, any Phlegma that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used in a two-minute buff window becomes free movement.</description></item><item><title>Warrior Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 12:38:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/advanced-guide/</guid><description>The Optimization Warrior Optimization focuses on manipulating the Surging Tempest buff refreshes, and “Carrying buffs” such as Nascent Chaos and Primal Rend Ready.
There’s also the case of pushing out “3 IC Pot” windows and “2 IC Tricks”, but also disrespecting various mechanics by zeroing out the damage, or canceling a knockback with our Onslaught. Also, if you want a high percentile in FFLogs, you&amp;rsquo;re at the mercy of a good kill time.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/openers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 21:43:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/openers/</guid><description>Opener The most up to date Astrologian opener(s) can always be found in the #ast_resources channel on The Balance Discord. Keep in mind that Astrologian openers are extremely flexible and depend almost entirely on the circumstances of the fight, the timings of the planned raid DPS bursts, and party composition. Any premade Astrologian opener is a generic framework, not a universally optimal opener.
We&amp;rsquo;ve taken a lot of care to evaluate as many of the variables as we reasonably can and identify the core methodology of the most statistically successful opener with regard to when most DPS jobs burst the hardest and when other raid buffs should be coming out, assuming everyone is doing a proper opener.</description></item><item><title>Warrior Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 22:38:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/stat-priority/</guid><description>Universal Stat Priorities are:
Weapon Damage &amp;raquo;&amp;gt; Main Stat &amp;raquo;&amp;raquo; Substats. Very few exceptions have existed before Endwalker. Direct Hit is avoided for the most part because of how Inner Chaos and Inner Release work:

P1s:
Nothing special. Full uptime fight.
Holmgang big busters 1 and 4.
P2s:
-9s Prepull IR might be a gain.
However, it is possible to do a basic IC IR IC opener, and keep IR on cooldown while managing mechanics.
Yes, you can use IR before Limit Cut happens. You&amp;rsquo;ll get 2-3 IR FCs out.
If you only got 2 IR FCs out, the third one will stay ready until the boss is back again.</description></item><item><title>Warrior Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 22:18:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/warrior/best-in-slot/</guid><description>What is the BiS for Ultimates?

Do your job quests every five levels. Upgrade your gear every 2-5 levels. Remember your role actions. Gear We want Strength and Vitality. And Weapon Damage. Lots of Weapon Damage.

2.11 GCD BiS https://etro.gg/gearset/33b9d186-963a-4cdb-84a0-6b2ebbadc652
2.10 GCD BiS https://etro.gg/gearset/c1c01cbb-f99b-4ba8-bbe3-e9d03a76b280
Use the 2.12 GCD BiS for general play, the 2.11 plays around potential extra gcds and is more consistent at doing triple Bhavas in Tricks, which still wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in every fight, and also requires a lower ping to work.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 04:19:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/stat-priority/</guid><description>Highest iLvl gear available generally will be the best option, regardless of substats, thanks to an increase in Dexterity and Weapon Damage.

Q: Are there any Shukuchi macros?
A: Yes, the main ones use either to go to your target at the time, or use &amp;lt;1&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;2&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;3&amp;gt;, etc to go to specific party members.
Q: Why does our BiS not follow the stat priority?
A: Because of stat tiering and how it works together with our rotation, our rotation simulation brought out this exact combination of materia to be a higher average DPS value than fully following our stat priority.</description></item><item><title>Summoner FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/faq/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 09:20:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/faq/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Summoner Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 09:16:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/stat-priority/</guid><description>As a general rule we recommend:
SpS to 2.46-2.48 &amp;gt; Crit &amp;gt; Det &amp;gt;= DH &amp;gt; More SpS
There is an alternative way to play the job that focuses on maximizing SpS and minimizing Crit instead, which would use this priority:
SpS &amp;gt; Det &amp;gt;= DH &amp;gt; Crit
In general, the Crit set appears better for most situations. Spell speed as a stat excels when it can be fine-tuned around a fight’s timeline, but you can choose to use the SpS set blindly if you wish.</description></item><item><title>Summoner Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 09:12:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/best-in-slot/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Summoner Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/openers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 08:48:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/openers/</guid><description>Openers General Purpose The below opener is the general go-to opener for Summoner and uses Titan as the first primal.

Diurnal remains generally very efficient, but buffs to Celestial Opposition and Celestial Intersection reduce the reliance on GCD healing (which is where Nocturnal Sect primarily falls short of Diurnal), and Nocturnal Intersection is very strong.

So we&amp;rsquo;re here, finally with a proper writeup.
Making BiS was expected to be very difficult this tier with AST&amp;rsquo;s new affinity for SpS&amp;hellip;but instead it actually was quite easy. Avoid Piety like the plague and there you go, there&amp;rsquo;s your BiS pieces.
Higher Piety sets also have the nice consolation of having a wealth of Crit (rather than the traditional disgusting amounts of Det) so it won&amp;rsquo;t even feel that bad to swap to lower damage for the sake of Piety.</description></item><item><title>Scholar Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 05:22:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/openers/</guid><description>Remember that the exact ability usage in these openers is not strict. If you need to use a heal in the opener or hold an AF stack for later healing do so. This is the ability usage you&amp;rsquo;d do on a dummy, but not every fight allows for it.
Chain Stratagem is varied, it has several factors that impact its usage within a raid setting. Usually, it is dependent on composition, but may also need to be adjusted for fight timings, though these situations are fairly rare.</description></item><item><title>Scholar FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 05:14:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/faq/</guid><description>Scholar FAQ How can I see my fairy&amp;rsquo;s nameplate in battle?

Meld SpS to a comfy tier if you wish, low priority during prog.
Piety is a binary stat, as any more than you needed to not run out of mp was wasted stats. Because of this, when choosing our substats, avoiding excess Piety is the best way for us to increase our damage, and you&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes see our low piety sets use lower iLvl equipment to avoid Piety (this is still the exception rather than the rule, don&amp;rsquo;t actively use lower iLvl items to dodge Piety without calculating out the gain yourself).</description></item><item><title>White Mage Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 04:57:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/openers/</guid><description>Standard Opener In most cases, use this:

White Mage (WHM) is one of the least mobile jobs in the game, and so planning movement is critical to success. Below is a list of available options; keep in mind that it’s heavily subjective based on the encounter and your party.
Pre-position with slidecasts and natural Dia refreshes Natural Dia refresh (&amp;lt; ~3s remaining), slidecast, or Swiftcast + Glare (not clipped, always consider holding for raise in prog) Rapture that does useful healing, Misery Regen that does necessary healing (rare in Savage and below) Overheal Lilies Dia outside natural refresh (almost always avoidable) Extended movements involve a combination of these roughly in order of priority, and a lot of movement can be minimized with proper prepositioning utilizing a combination of Dia and slidecasting.</description></item><item><title>Bard Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2022 04:45:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Hello!

Raiden Thrust is an upgraded True Thrust. It combos into both Disembowel and Vorpal Thrust and replaces True Thrust on your bar when it’s ready.

Circle of Scorn is used before Fight or Flight in most openers and kept on cooldown in most phases for two reasons:
Its short cooldown (25 seconds) is equal to the duration of Fight or Flight, meaning one CoS usage should always occur during FoF regardless of their respective timings, given full uptime. Its high DoT uptime (~60%) means that any delays are likely to cost ticks at the end of the phase, resulting in a potency loss overall.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 00:28:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</guid><description>Paladin Openers Tanks currently use Grade 6 Tinctures of Strength (Strength also affects tank magic potency, including healing)
The choice of opener is encounter-specific and depends on factors such as when downtime happens, melee disengages and choice of strat, kill-times, etc. See the Encounter Optimization page (Coming Soon!) for encounter-specific optimization.

The single most likely reason is that you aren’t weaving Blood Weapon late into the GCD. As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be very consistent. With high latency (100+ ms), double weaves can cause the last GCD to fall out of Blood Weapon.</description></item><item><title>Red Mage Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 20:49:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/basic-guide/</guid><description>Red Mage Level 90 Guide for 6.x Overview This guide will cover changes to Red Mage and proper rotations and ability usage in the Endwalker expansion.

Why do we cast Verthunder twice?
Casting Verthunder twice is intentional as it allows us to guarantee a proc from Verholy as we will have lower white mana when we use it, resulting in us having both procs after our melee combo. You can also do this in the reverse order, casting Veraero twice and then Verflare.
Why are we potting a GCD later than usual?
Potting after the 2nd GCD allows us to use both Swiftcast and Acceleration after the first GCD, beginning the cooldown of both of those abilities and allowing us to comfortably weave our potion, Manafication, and Embolden in the next 2 GCDs.</description></item><item><title>Red Mage Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 21:11:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Red Mage Leveling Guide for 6.x Introduction The purpose of this guide is to assist players new to either Red Mage, or to the game entirely in learning how to properly play both their job and their role as they level up to 90.

Wildfire does not scale with skill speed, so once it’s placed in your opener it will never move forward and can only be delayed in your rotation. Wildfire should be placed properly in the opener based on your party composition and the downtime you have in an encounter.

Note: Early progression gear will often provide very different skill speed values from BiS.</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:43:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dark Knight Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:34:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/skills-overview/</guid><description>Dark Knight Skills Overview Abilities will be presented in a tabular format for easy reading.

Its rotation features large bursts of damage, accompanied by spikes in actions per minute (APM) and requires managing both MP and a Blood Gauge, putting many hard-hitting attacks into party raid buff windows. It also has access to one of the most powerful single-target mitigation abilities available in The Blackest Night (TBN).</description></item><item><title>Paladin Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:32:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/advanced-guide/</guid><description>This section assumes that you are comfortable with the entirety of the Paladin kit, as well as the basic rotation outlined in the Intro &amp;amp; Rotation Guide.
If that is not the case, please turn back.
Introduction to Paladin Optimization Because Paladin&amp;rsquo;s self-buffs (Fight or Flight and Requiescat) are very powerful compared to raid buffs (e.g. Trick Attack, Divination), much of Paladin optimization focuses around maximizing usages of personal buff windows within a given phase or killtime, sometimes at the cost of raid buff contribution.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:27:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</guid><description>Buffs Iron Will Toggle | 10s cooldown after toggling on. | No cooldown for toggling off.
Increases enmity generation by 10x (Enmity is also known as aggro, hate, etc.).
Keep this on in dungeons or as the main tank (in content with more than one tank).
Fight or Flight 60s cooldown.
+25% physical damage for 25 seconds.
By using Fight or Flight late into the GCD (just before the next GCD), it is possible to fit 11 physical GCDs into the buff window.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:20:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Paladin Leveling in Dungeons Keeping Aggro Turn on Iron Will and never turn it off. As long as you keep hitting the mobs, you will have aggro on them. In multi-target situations, use AoE so that you can keep aggro on all mobs.
Pulling Mobs There are a variety of ways to ensure you pull all of the mobs in a pack quickly and reliably, without stopping on your way to the next pack of mobs.</description></item><item><title>White Mage Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 00:54:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/stat-priority/</guid><description>In general this will boil down to choosing max item level gear with sufficient Piety while maximizing Crit, then melding Crit &amp;gt; DH/DET where possible, though Piety melds can be useful in a pinch if you end up too low.
Piety is a binary stat, as any more than you needed to not run out of mp was wasted stats. Because of this, when choosing our substats, avoiding excess Piety is the best way for us to increase our damage, and you&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes see our low piety sets use lower iLvl equipment to avoid Piety (this is still the exception rather than the rule, don&amp;rsquo;t actively use lower iLvl items to dodge Piety without calculating out the gain yourself).</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:17:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Astrologian Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:00:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</guid><description>So, you&amp;rsquo;re (hopefully) comfortable with the fundamentals of Astrologian.

Sect Swapping/Stance Dancing In dungeons, you can swap to Nocturnal Sect after the last enemy in a pull dies, apply a shield to the tank in preparation for the next pull, and then swap back to Diurnal Sect.</description></item><item><title>Bard Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 02:14:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/leveling-guide/</guid><description>A Guide For Bards That Aren’t Level 80 Yet While the main Balance guide is focused on level 80 gameplay, I thought it’d be nice to have something people can follow as they level.
