We heard you needed some pointers on how to play WAR while leveling. The splits below are done based on what skills you unlock, and what you should take into account.
Do your job quests every five levels. Upgrade your gear every 2-5 levels. Remember your role actions. Gear We want Strength and Vitality. And Weapon Damage. Lots of Weapon Damage. The marketboard is a good place to pick up some cheap upgrades fast, along with Dungeon/Quest/Tomestone gear.</description></item><item><title>Gunbreaker Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/openers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 23:31:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/openers/</guid><description>Opener Full Size</description></item><item><title>Dancer FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/faq/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 23:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/dancer/faq/</guid><description>DANCE PARTNER PRIORITY This list is made in a gear/skill vacuum.

The short answer is that our gear absolutely sucks for 2.41 this tier. We either have to take on a bunch of piety or use crafted gear, and neither one is efficient. 2.32 GCD lines up AF well, but sits on a sort of halfway point of DoT timings that requires us to alternate between 12 GCD and 13 GCD Bios, which can result in lost Bio ticks.</description></item><item><title>Reaper Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 08:59:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/reaper/openers/</guid><description>Fast Enshroud Opener Full Size

With all openers being very close in estimated output over the course of the entire encounter, it is instead recommended to choose your opener based on your current spell speed, with consideration towards potential fight-specific requirements.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/faq/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 17:22:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/faq/</guid><description>Q: What is Umbral Soul used for?

Job Overview Black Mage is a caster specializing in high, steady personal damage in place of providing party buffs. The job maintains a cyclical flow of expending MP via long, powerful casts in Astral Fire then swapping to refresh MP in Umbral Ice. While the rotation itself is somewhat simple, utilizing its movement tools and the flexibility built into its rotation to their fullest is key to maintaining uptime and maximizing damage as a Black Mage.</description></item><item><title>Bard Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 23:01:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/ranged/bard/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Hello! In this guide, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a series of details and optimizations for Endwalker Bard.
This builds on the Bard Basic Guide, and expects you to be familiar with Bard&amp;rsquo;s skills, general priorities, opener, and song cycle.
Topics are ordered based on some mix of importance and flow. It&amp;rsquo;s a little all over the place, but such is the nature of a kit like Bard&amp;rsquo;s.
The two-minute burst Like many jobs, Bard&amp;rsquo;s kit revolves around a big damage burst every two minutes.</description></item><item><title>Sage Skills</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 08:38:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/sage/skills-overview/</guid><description>Sage Spells and Abilities Icon Action Level Type Cast Time Recast MP Cost Description Dosis 1 Spell 1.5s 2.5s 400 Deals unaspected damage with a potency of 300.

A couple of GCDs into Minuet. This is to cover as much Pitch Perfect potential as possible.

Try to cover Raging Strikes and Barrage with it. That damage spike is bigger than any heap of party buffs.

Dragoons use Maiming armor and Slaying accessories. Low level gear may not be labeled as such, so make sure you always equip gear that gives a bonus to Strength.

How does Raiden Thrust work?
Raiden Thrust is an upgraded True Thrust. It combos into both Disembowel and Vorpal Thrust and replaces True Thrust on your bar when it’s ready. You activate it by successfully landing the positional on the fifth hit of your combo (Fang and Claw or Wheeling Thrust following Wheeling Thrust or Fang and Claw, respectively).</description></item><item><title>Scholar Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 22:33:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/skills-overview/</guid><description>Notable Endwalker Changes Broil IV cast time is reduced to 1.5s base cast time. You can weave one oGCD after it without clipping. Do not use Ruin II for weaving. New skills: Protraction and Expedient Shields apply at the slidecast window. It is now possible to cast Adloquium and immediately use Deployment Tactics, but this is still not recommended because this will clip GCD.

Circle of Scorn is used before Fight or Flight in most openers and kept on cooldown in most phases for two reasons:
Its short cooldown (25 seconds) is equal to the duration of Fight or Flight, meaning one CoS usage should always occur during FoF regardless of their respective timings, given full uptime. Its high DoT uptime (~60%) means that any delays are likely to cost ticks at the end of the phase, resulting in a potency loss overall.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 00:28:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</guid><description>Paladin Openers Tanks currently use Grade 6 Tinctures of Strength (Strength also affects tank magic potency, including healing)
The choice of opener is encounter-specific and depends on factors such as when downtime happens, melee disengages and choice of strat, kill-times, etc. See the Encounter Optimization page (Coming Soon!) for encounter-specific optimization.

The single most likely reason is that you aren’t weaving Blood Weapon late into the GCD. As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be very consistent. With high latency (100+ ms), double weaves can cause the last GCD to fall out of Blood Weapon.</description></item><item><title>Red Mage Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 20:49:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/basic-guide/</guid><description>Red Mage Level 90 Guide for 6.x Overview This guide will cover changes to Red Mage and proper rotations and ability usage in the Endwalker expansion.

Why do we cast Verthunder twice?
Casting Verthunder twice is intentional as it allows us to guarantee a proc from Verholy as we will have lower white mana when we use it, resulting in us having both procs after our melee combo. You can also do this in the reverse order, casting Veraero twice and then Verflare.
Why are we potting a GCD later than usual?
Potting after the 2nd GCD allows us to use both Swiftcast and Acceleration after the first GCD, beginning the cooldown of both of those abilities and allowing us to comfortably weave our potion, Manafication, and Embolden in the next 2 GCDs.</description></item><item><title>Red Mage Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 21:11:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/red-mage/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Red Mage Leveling Guide for 6.x Introduction The purpose of this guide is to assist players new to either Red Mage, or to the game entirely in learning how to properly play both their job and their role as they level up to 90.

Use the 2.12 GCD BiS for general play, the 2.11 plays around potential extra gcds and is more consistent at doing triple Bhavas in Tricks, which still wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in every fight, and also requires a lower ping to work.</description></item><item><title>Ninja FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/faq/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 03:10:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions:
Q: Are there any Shukuchi macros?
A: Yes, the main ones use either to go to your target at the time, or use &amp;lt;1&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;2&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;3&amp;gt;, etc to go to specific party members.
Q: Why does our BiS not follow the stat priority?
A: Because of stat tiering and how it works together with our rotation, our rotation simulation brought out this exact combination of materia to be a higher average DPS value than fully following our stat priority.</description></item><item><title>Ninja Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/openers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 03:09:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/ninja/openers/</guid><description>Why is there a Doton in my opener?

You have strict, long combos to execute and timers within those combos that need to be maintained. Unlike other Jobs - especially other melee - which rely upon a priority system for their basic GCD rotation, Dragoon instead has static buttons to press in a specific order with very little variance. Shadowbringers brings with it a new reliance on hitting proper positionals to trigger new skills.</description></item><item><title>Monk Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 03:55:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Monk Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 03:54:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/best-in-slot/</guid><description>What do I meld on gear generally?

For same-ilvl pieces: substat itemization can be in your favor or not depending on the rest of your gear and stat tiering.

Its rotation features large bursts of damage, accompanied by spikes in actions per minute (APM) and requires managing both MP and a Blood Gauge, putting many hard-hitting attacks into party raid buff windows. It also has access to one of the most powerful single-target mitigation abilities available in The Blackest Night (TBN).</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:23:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Introduction First off, a word of warning: Do not use the gear given out by the first job quest. It is normal-quality, meaning its stats are significantly weaker than other gear of the same item level. The Steel Cuirass (ilvl30), for example, has about the same defense as a high-quality Iron Scale Mail (ilvl 23).

Introduction to Paladin Optimization Because Paladin&amp;rsquo;s self-buffs (Fight or Flight and Requiescat) are very powerful compared to raid buffs (e.g. Trick Attack, Divination), much of Paladin optimization focuses around maximizing usages of personal buff windows within a given phase or killtime, sometimes at the cost of raid buff contribution.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:27:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</guid><description>Buffs Iron Will Toggle | 10s cooldown after toggling on. | No cooldown for toggling off.

White Mage (WHM) is one of the least mobile jobs in the game, and so planning movement is critical to success. Below is a list of available options; keep in mind that it’s heavily subjective based on the encounter and your party.
Pre-position with slidecasts and natural Dia refreshes Natural Dia refresh (&amp;lt; ~3s remaining), slidecast, or Swiftcast + Glare (not clipped, always consider holding for raise in prog) Rapture that does useful healing, Misery Regen that does necessary healing (rare in Savage and below) Overheal Lilies Dia outside natural refresh (almost always avoidable) Extended movements involve a combination of these roughly in order of priority, and a lot of movement can be minimized with proper prepositioning utilizing a combination of Dia and slidecasting.</description></item><item><title>White Mage Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 00:17:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/white-mage/best-in-slot/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Scholar Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/openers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 00:13:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/scholar/openers/</guid><description>Scholar’s kit has a few select tools whose usage dictates how the rest of the opener operates: namely Dissipation and Chain Stratagem.

So we&amp;rsquo;re here, finally with a proper writeup.
Making BiS was expected to be very difficult this tier with AST&amp;rsquo;s new affinity for SpS&amp;hellip;but instead it actually was quite easy. Avoid Piety like the plague and there you go, there&amp;rsquo;s your BiS pieces.
Higher Piety sets also have the nice consolation of having a wealth of Crit (rather than the traditional disgusting amounts of Det) so it won&amp;rsquo;t even feel that bad to swap to lower damage for the sake of Piety.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:00:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/advanced-guide/</guid><description>So, you&amp;rsquo;re (hopefully) comfortable with the fundamentals of Astrologian. Now, it’s time to talk details: quirky mechanics, important interactions, and optimization. We’ll start with the most straightforward topics and work up to the more complicated ones.
Sect Swapping/Stance Dancing In dungeons, you can swap to Nocturnal Sect after the last enemy in a pull dies, apply a shield to the tank in preparation for the next pull, and then swap back to Diurnal Sect.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:58:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/faq/</guid><description>What Sect Should I Use? Diurnal remains generally very efficient, but buffs to Celestial Opposition and Celestial Intersection reduce the reliance on GCD healing (which is where Nocturnal Sect primarily falls short of Diurnal), and Nocturnal Intersection is very strong. The gap in overall efficiency between Diurnal and Nocturnal Sect is still quite significant, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put you off of using Nocturnal Sect when the situation calls for it.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:51:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/openers/</guid><description>Opener The most up to date Astrologian opener(s) can always be found in the #ast_resources channel on The Balance Discord. Keep in mind that Astrologian openers are extremely flexible and depend almost entirely on the circumstances of the fight, the timings of the planned raid DPS bursts, and party composition. Any premade Astrologian opener is a generic framework, not a universally optimal opener.
We&amp;rsquo;ve taken a lot of care to evaluate as many of the variables as we reasonably can and identify the core methodology of the most statistically successful opener with regard to when most DPS jobs burst the hardest and when other raid buffs should be coming out, assuming everyone is doing a proper opener.</description></item><item><title>Astrologian Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:48:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/healers/astrologian/skills-overview/</guid><description>Actions Icon Action Level Type MP Casting Recast Description Malefic 1 Spell 400 1.5s 2.5s Deals unaspected damage with a potency of 150.
