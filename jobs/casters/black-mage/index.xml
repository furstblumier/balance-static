All openers assume there is a pull countdown and the boss is pulled at 0. If your group pulls earlier, adjust them as necessary. Use the highest tier Tincture / Infusion / Potion of Intelligence available.
With all openers being very close in estimated output over the course of the entire encounter, it is instead recommended to choose your opener based on your current spellspeed, with consideration towards potential fight-specific requirements.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 02:02:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Black Mage Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:58:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/best-in-slot/</guid><description>BiS: &amp;ldquo;Speed 3655 SpS Tier (Relic)&amp;quot;:

I am Reina, a caster player, and I am standing on the shoulders of giants. This document aims to provide a comprehensive guide on non-standard rotation (also known as AI or Hypermeme rotation). There is the assumption you know all of the basics of BLM, including abbreviations and fundamentals. If not, refer to the BLM Basic Guide before proceeding here. This guide will not bring you from 75% to 95% nor will it magically make you a good BLM player.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/faq/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:53:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/faq/</guid><description>Q: What is Umbral Soul used for? A: Purely a downtime tool, a better version of Transpose. Lets you build back up to Umbral Ice III + Three Umbral Hearts during downtime, so you can Thunder III -&amp;gt; Fire III when you can hit something again. If you end a fight in Astral Fire, Transpose into UI so you can use Umbral Soul. Do not use Umbral Soul during uptime.</description></item><item><title>Black Mage Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 01:49:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/black-mage/skills-overview/</guid><description>Actions Icon Action Level Type MP Casting Recast Description Blizzard 1 Spell 400 2.5s 2.5s Deals ice damage with a potency of 180.
