SpS to 2.46-2.48 &amp;gt; Crit &amp;gt; Det &amp;gt;= DH &amp;gt; More SpS
There is an alternative way to play the job that focuses on maximizing SpS and minimizing Crit instead, which would use this priority:
SpS &amp;gt; Det &amp;gt;= DH &amp;gt; Crit
In general, the Crit set appears better for most situations. Spell speed as a stat excels when it can be fine-tuned around a fight’s timeline, but you can choose to use the SpS set blindly if you wish.</description></item><item><title>Summoner Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 09:12:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/best-in-slot/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Summoner Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/openers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 08:48:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/openers/</guid><description>Openers General Purpose The below opener is the general go-to opener for Summoner and uses Titan as the first primal. The initial Searing Light weave will clip your GCD slightly, but this is an acceptable clip. You can also shift Searing Light one GCD later if you need to avoid this clip for any reason.
You do also have the option of cutting the second Ruin III and doing Bahamut immediately as well.</description></item><item><title>Summoner Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 23:12:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/casters/summoner/skills-overview/</guid><description>Actions Icon Action Level Type MP Casting Recast Description Ruin 1 Spell 200 2.5s 2.5s Deals unaspected damage with a potency of 180.

This page is written to provide an introduction to Summoner at Level 80. With Summoner’s well known reputation for being a “complex” job for new players to pick up and understand, our goal is to provide a condensed and easy-to-understand guideline for how the job functions at max level, while breaking down everything into simplified priority lists that can be followed. We hope this guide proves helpful to accomplishing this goal, and wish you the best of luck with your Summoner journey!</description></item></channel></rss>
