Use the Tank Gear Manager (https://bit.ly/TankDPSCalc520) to make your own gearing decisions based on personal loot availability. Prioritizing item level over substats is encouraged while learning new encounters.
Note: Early progression gear will often provide very different skill speed values from BiS.</description></item><item><title>Paladin FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/faq/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:10:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/faq/</guid><description>Why is Circle of Scorn used immediately in the opener?
Circle of Scorn is used before Fight or Flight in most openers and kept on cooldown in most phases for two reasons:
Its short cooldown (25 seconds) is equal to the duration of Fight or Flight, meaning one CoS usage should always occur during FoF regardless of their respective timings, given full uptime. Its high DoT uptime (~60%) means that any delays are likely to cost ticks at the end of the phase, resulting in a potency loss overall.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:35:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Paladin Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:32:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/advanced-guide/</guid><description>This section assumes that you are comfortable with the entirety of the Paladin kit, as well as the basic rotation outlined in the Intro &amp;amp; Rotation Guide.

Introduction to Paladin Optimization Because Paladin&amp;rsquo;s self-buffs (Fight or Flight and Requiescat) are very powerful compared to raid buffs (e.g. Trick Attack, Divination), much of Paladin optimization focuses around maximizing usages of personal buff windows within a given phase or killtime, sometimes at the cost of raid buff contribution.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:29:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/openers/</guid><description>Paladin Opener and Rotation Tanks currently use Grade 4 Tinctures of Strength (Strength also affects tank magic potency, including healing)
Quick Opener/Rotation Graphic: Alternative In-Depth Graphic: 60 Second Rotation Paladin&amp;rsquo;s natural rotation is approximately 63 seconds long, which means Fight or Flight and Requiescat (both with 60-second cooldowns) are delayed by 1 GCD per minute. In some situations this can cost FoF GCDs or even a Confiteor usage before the end of a phase, and in long encounters with minimal downtime, physical oGCDs must eventually be delayed as well to stay lined up with FoF.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:27:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/skills-overview/</guid><description>Buffs Iron Will Toggle | 10s cooldown after toggling on. | No cooldown for toggling off.
Increases enmity generation by 10x (Enmity is also known as aggro, hate, etc.).
Keep this on in dungeons or as the main tank (in content with more than one tank).
Fight or Flight 60s cooldown.
+25% physical damage for 25 seconds.
By using Fight or Flight late into the GCD (just before the next GCD), it is possible to fit 11 physical GCDs into the buff window.</description></item><item><title>Paladin Basic Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/basic-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 08:23:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/paladin/basic-guide/</guid><description>the useless pre-Endwalker guide update by nikroulah#1605

As long as you keep hitting the mobs, you will have aggro on them. In multi-target situations, use AoE so that you can keep aggro on all mobs.
Pulling Mobs There are a variety of ways to ensure you pull all of the mobs in a pack quickly and reliably, without stopping on your way to the next pack of mobs.</description></item></channel></rss>
