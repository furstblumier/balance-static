Fight timings and party composition can both affect which opener is best, based on when you can keep uptime on the boss and when raid buffs are used. Fight-specific opener information can be found in #drk_encounter and #drk_questions (often in the pins). This section will list some General-purpose DRK openers which work relatively well in most situations.</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 21:45:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/faq/</guid><description>Frequently Asked Questions Why can’t I fit five GCDs in Blood Weapon (or Delirium)? The single most likely reason is that you aren’t weaving Blood Weapon late into the GCD. As long as you are weaving Blood Weapon late and keeping the GCD rolling during it, five GCDs in Blood Weapon should be very consistent. With high latency (100+ ms), double weaves can cause the last GCD to fall out of Blood Weapon.</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 03:41:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dark Knight Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:44:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Dark Knight Best In Slot Day one prog set(s) will be listed immediately when a new tier is released, but pre-BiS sets will otherwise not be maintained on this page. Use the Tank Gear Manager (https://bit.ly/TankDPSCalc520) to make your own gearing decisions based on what gear is available to you. Prioritizing item level over substats is generally recommended while learning new encounters.
Note: Early progression gear will often provide very different skill speed values from BiS.</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:43:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dark Knight Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:34:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/skills-overview/</guid><description>Tank Stance Grit

Its rotation features large bursts of damage, accompanied by spikes in actions per minute (APM) and requires managing both MP and a Blood Gauge, putting many hard-hitting attacks into party raid buff windows. It also has access to one of the most powerful single-target mitigation abilities available in The Blackest Night (TBN).</description></item><item><title>Dark Knight Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:23:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/tanks/dark-knight/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Introduction First off, a word of warning: Do not use the gear given out by the first job quest. It is normal-quality, meaning its stats are significantly weaker than other gear of the same item level. The Steel Cuirass (ilvl30), for example, has about the same defense as a high-quality Iron Scale Mail (ilvl 23).
