Get abilities on cooldown as soon as possible. This keeps us from sitting on skills that are ready which could potentially cause lost usages. Get strong abilities under raid buffs. This helps to maximize damage done. More damage is always better, especially when it&amp;rsquo;s free! Set up our rotation for the rest of the fight (or until a transition/extended period of downtime).</description></item><item><title>Gunbreaker Skills Overview</title><link>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 21:30:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://guides.xivresources.com/jobs/tanks/gunbreaker/skills-overview/</guid><description>Gunbreaker Skills Overview Offensive On Global Cool Down Abilities Keen Edge The first skill of our basic combo. 200 potency.

It features high damage output and high casts-per-minute. GNB also features a strong defensive kit that, when used properly, can bring a lot of mitigation to the table. Let’s get started with a brief overview of the skills and abilities available to GNB.

Even though GNB starts at level 60, sometimes you may be Level Synced to below 60.
No Mercy is unlocked at level 2, so you will have it available for any content. While in combat, you should always use No Mercy on cooldown. This is not a list of openers, but a general priority of what you should be using at each level.</description></item></channel></rss>
