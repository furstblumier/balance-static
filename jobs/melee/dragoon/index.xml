Burst windows can get hectic, and prioritizing the various skills you need to execute can become a rather significant hassle in some instances. Endwalker has doubled down on this by introducing the ability to utilize yet more off-GCD actions at regular intervals, as if we didn’t have enough already.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Changes</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/job-changes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:19:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/job-changes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dragoon Leveling Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 06:14:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/leveling-guide/</guid><description>Dragoon Leveling Guide Gear Always use the highest Item Level gear available to you. The increase of Strength and survivability outweighs potentially more favorable substats in lower Item Level gear.

Know Your Role Melee DPS jobs have a unique mechanic in Positionals.</description></item><item><title>Dragoon Stat Priority</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/stat-priority/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 14:30:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/stat-priority/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dragoon Best in Slot (BiS)</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/best-in-slot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 14:12:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/dragoon/best-in-slot/</guid><description>Dragoon Best-in-Slot Lists 5.55 Best-in-Slot Gearsets 2.50 GCD (Raid Chest) - http://bit.ly/drg250raid

How does Raiden Thrust work?
Raiden Thrust is an upgraded True Thrust. It combos into both Disembowel and Vorpal Thrust and replaces True Thrust on your bar when it’s ready.
