However, it is recommended to use the highest item level gear available to you, as it will give you more of your primary stat which will always result in a higher DPS gain than lower item level counterparts.
When melding with Materia it is advised to follow the same stat priority.</description></item><item><title>Viper Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/viper/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 19:16:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/viper/skills-overview/</guid><description>Please note that all of the following actions are based on Viper at level 100, and may not reflect their lower level version effects or potencies.
