<h2 id=overview>Overview</h2>
<p>Ninja is a fast-paced yet flexible job with a high focus on a powerful burst every one and two minutes. It is unique from other jobs with its utilization of Ninjutsus, a combo-like system allowing a Ninja to form a multitude of ranged attacks. It also has one of the most frequent raid buffs (Trick Attack) where we emphasize landing all our biggest attacks within 15.77s.</p>
<p>If you want a melee job with the most flexibility for disengagements and has a fast-paced burst phase and relaxing filler phase, then Ninja might just be the job for you!</p>

<p>Huton grants us with a 15% reduction in auto-attack delay and skill-speed. This is one of the first gauges we get, and it is crucial for us to maintain this gauge with the use of Armor Crush when the gauge is 30s or below. Use of Armor Crush above 30s will result in waste of Huton gauge, which should be avoided. To start using Huton, we will cast Huton prepull. Huraijin is only ever used if our Huton drops on accident, on death, or through a long downtime segment.</p>

</div>
</p>
<p>Ninki is the second gauge we receive, and allows us to accumulate resources for use of Bhavacakra, Hellfrog Medium or Bunshin. Below is a table listing every ability and their Ninki amount. Bunshin will also add +5 Ninki to any GCD that consumes a stack of Bunshin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we ought to avoid ever overcapping on Ninki, even if we must burn gauge right before Trick Attack. Overcapped Ninki is potential oGCD loss, which is a far larger loss than the gain of getting more Bhavacakras under Trick.</p>

<p>Trick Attack is our single-target raid buff that increases damage by 5% for anyone hitting the target for 15.77 seconds every minute. This is one of our most important skills and provides a tremendous amount of utility for the party and yourself. Our goal is to utilize our own Trick Attack and fit as many high potency abilities as we can before it ends.</p>
<p>At a glance, we want to fit Hyosho Ranyru, x2 Raitons, Ten-Chi-Jin, Dream Within a Dream, x2 Fleeting/Forked Raijus, Meisui, and as many Bhavacakras as we can weave.</p>
<p>Ninjutsus are unique abilities that we formulate with the Mudras: Ten, Chi and Jin. Refer to this <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/919447066168668171/920093248360439818/MUDRA_GUIDE_ew.png?width=704&height=545">cheat sheet</a> for all the different mudra combinations.</p>
<p>Kassatsu is an oGCD that grants an additional Ninjutsu and converts certain Ninjutsu combinations into much more powerful Ninjutsus. The buff lasts 15 seconds, so weaving this within the Trick Attack window is generally unnecessary. Kassatsu transforms Hyoton into Hyosho, and Katon into Goka Mekkyaku.</p>

<p>This is the best general play opener for NIN. Unlike Shadowbringers, we will be using Trick Attack slightly earlier to align with other buffs and jobs. Some important notes are preparing Suiton at -6s and then casting at -1s to ensure you pull on time. This will not early pull the boss, as the damage takes one second to register. Doing this means our Mudra cooldown will be sooner, and that we will be able to fit x2 Raitons within all Trick windows post opener.</p>
<p>Next, we will be <strong>late weaving</strong> Trick Attack. This is <strong>ONLY</strong> for the opener and is done for alignment purposes. You should late weave as much as possible without clipping your next GCD. This will depend on your ping. After the opener, we should strictly keep Trick Attack off cooldown and prevent it from drifting as much as possible.</p>
<p>Lastly, getting that last Spinning Edge is extremely tight but possible on any GCD speed 2.12 or below. If you play at >40ms ping, you can skip the Spinning Edge and go straight into casting Raiton.</p>
<h2 id=basic-rotation>Basic Rotation</h2>
<h3 id=filler>Filler</h3>
<p>Outside of a Trick Attack window, we will fill out most of our rotation with use of Spinning Edge -> Gust Slash -> Aeolian Edge. This is known as our <strong>filler</strong> and it allows us to burn time and continue doing damage until our next burst window. We will also be building plenty of Ninki in this time, and should burn any Ninki before we overcap.</p>
<p>While normally we will be using Aeolian Edge as our standard combo finisher, we should switch to <strong>Armor Crush</strong> when any of the following is met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our Huton gauge is somewhere below 30s.</li>
<li>We need to cap Huton gauge to pull us through a long downtime segment. It would be better to overcap on Huton than drop it and be forced to use Huraijin on the reopener.</li>
<li>We are at the flank of the boss and are unable to go to the rear or don’t have True North available. Even if we overcap gauge, an Armor Crush with positional bonus is better than an Aeolian Edge without positional bonus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Huraijin shouldn’t be part of our rotation, and isn’t the optimal GCD to use to maintain our Huton gauge. We will only use Huraijin in situations where our Huton drops, such as on accident, death or through a long downtime segment.</p>
<h3 id=ninki-maintenance>Ninki Maintenance</h3>
<p>Throughout our rotation we will be building resources and spending Ninki as needed. Optimally, it is best if we pool our Ninki as high as possible <strong>without</strong> overcapping for our Trick Attack window, then dump as much Bhavacakras as weave space provides. Generally this will look to be between one to four Bhavacakras per Trick window.</p>

<p>It is important for a Ninja to understand and confidently know each Ninjutsu combination, as our rotation demands excessive use of Ten, Chi and Jin to formulate some of our strongest GCDs. With a 20s cooldown on our mudras, we expect to get 3 natural Ninjutsus a minute. One Ninjutsu will be used on <strong>Suiton</strong> when Trick Attack is 20s or less on cooldown, as we need the Suiton buff to use Trick. The other two should be used ideally within Trick Attack as <strong>Raitons</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Kassatsu</strong> provides us with an additional Ninjutsu every minute and should be used as Hyosho Ranyru on one to two targets, or as Goka Mekkyaku when there are 3+ targets.</p>
<p>The only time we should <strong>not use</strong> Raiton within Trick Attack is when one of the following is met:</p>
<ol>
<li>We must disconnect from the boss, and do not have Phantom Kamaitachi nor have the option to use Suiton to prepare Trick Attack. Using Raton to disconnect and keep our GCD rolling is far better than using Throwing Dagger, even if that means one less Raiton + Raiju in Trick Attack.</li>
<li>We need to prevent mudra <strong>overcap</strong> by using a Ninjutsu. If Trick is used strictly off cooldown, we won’t ever have this issue, and two Raitons will naturally be within Trick with little to no overcap. However, a common occurrence is if we ever <strong>hold</strong> Trick Attack, normally for a mechanic. Any time we hold Trick Attack, we will overcap Mudra stacks if attempting to fit both Raitons within Trick. Therefore, one Raiton must be used outside of Trick Attack to prevent overcap.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Overcapping</strong> should be avoided when it comes to our mudra stacks. This happens when our mudra ever stacks to x2. Any time spent with overcapped mudra is time that pushes our mudra cooldown backwards into our rotation timeline. Doing so can make fitting two Raitons into Trick difficult or even cost us an entire use of a Raiton by the end of the fight.</p>
<p>Holding Trick and downtime are common causes for mudra overcap. Most of the time, it is best to use Raiton to avoid overcap even if that means 1 less Raiton within Trick.</p>
<h3 id=multi-target>Multi-Target</h3>
<p><strong>Doton</strong> does 70p per tick (every three), with one additional tick happening the moment you drop the Doton. That’s a total of nine ticks for 630p. You should use this pre-pull for boss pulls, if you are able to. Otherwise, Doton should be used on two targets when they sit within the Doton for at least ~18s (or seven ticks), three targets for at least ~12s (5 ticks) and four targets for at least ~6s (three ticks).</p>
<p><strong>Katon</strong> should only be used on 3+ targets, and ideally when Doton is placed to be able to proc Hollow Nozuchi.</p>
<p><strong>Goka Mekkyaku</strong> is much like Katon and should only be used on 3+ targets, and ideally within Doton.</p>
<p><strong>Death Blossom & Hakke</strong> can be used on a group of mobs of 3+ targets and ideally within Doton.</p>
<p><strong>Hellfrog Medium</strong> should also be used on a group of mobs of 3+ targets with the exception when the Meisui buff is active. When Meisui is active, use Hellfrog over Bhavacakra on 4+ targets.</p>
<h2 id=trick-attack-burst><strong>Trick Attack Burst</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most important steps to learning Ninja and playing optimally is understanding and getting confidence with execution of our Trick Attack windows. Given that Trick is 15.77s long, we will be cramming a large array of abilities in a short period of time.</p>
<p>We have two versions of our Trick Attack burst, the <strong>odd</strong> (1m, 3m, 5m…) windows and <strong>even</strong> (2m, 4m, 6m…) windows.</p>
<h3 id=odd-trick>Odd Trick</h3>
<p>This is a window that happens every odd minute or is better identified by its absence of 2-minute cooldowns. This window is easier to execute than the Even Window, for there are a lot less abilities we will cram within the window.</p>
<p>We should try to fit one <strong>Hyosho</strong>, two <strong>Raitons</strong>, two <strong>Raijus</strong>, <strong>Dream Within A Dream</strong>, and as many <strong>Bhavacakras</strong> as we have available. Any extra time we have, we will use our standard 1-2-3 combos.</p>
<p>If Bunshin was used 45s within an odd Trick window, and Phantom Kamaitachi was NOT used to disengage from the boss, we should also have x1 <strong>Phantom Kamaitachi</strong> within an odd window.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<p>This example uses Spinning Edge first, allowing us to sooner use Dream Within A Dream to mitigate drift. As we will have standard GCDs within Trick in odd windows regardless, it does not matter if we start the window off with a GCD:</p>

</p>
<p>This next example starts off with Hyosho and uses Dream Within A Dream right after, but otherwise is extremely similar to the above:</p>

</p>
<p>This final example is when we want to drift Phantom Kamaitachi into the odd window. This can be placed anywhere as long as it is used before the buff falls off:</p>

</div>
</p>
<h3 id=even-trick>Even Trick</h3>
<p>This is a window that occurs every even minute or is a window that has all our 2-minute cooldowns available. The Even window is much like our Odd Trick, but will have Ten-Chi-Jin, Meisui and optionally Mug included.</p>
<p>We should try to fit one <strong>Hyosho</strong>, two <strong>Raitons</strong>, two <strong>Raijus</strong>, <strong>Dream Within A Dream</strong>, <strong>Ten-Chi-Jin</strong>, <strong>Meisui</strong>, and as many <strong>Bhavacakras</strong> as possible. If you are able to double weave (&lt;40ms ping), you can also drift <strong>Mug</strong> into Trick for an additional Bhavacakra.</p>
<p>Phantom Kamaitachi, however, should <strong>NOT</strong> be used within an Even Trick window, as it does less damage than either of our Raijus. There are some exceptions, such as if the extra Ninki would otherwise grant you an extra Bhavacakra, or if replacing a Raiton results in a gain of two GCDs (i,e. a late-woven Trick).</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/9078c445-96b1-45cc-87ea-5ed775a0a033/df0x5w6-2c6aff1b-0805-4ec1-939c-76ae8f1d26c2.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzkwNzhjNDQ1LTk2YjEtNDVjYy04N2VhLTVlZDc3NWEwYTAzM1wvZGYweDV3Ni0yYzZhZmYxYi0wODA1LTRlYzEtOTM5Yy03NmFlOGYxZDI2YzIucG5nIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.B6IQht5_Ek1oDlbwcNpERxnrev6kUZbe89vAeZxZpC4">Infographic</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: There are plenty of ways to execute an even/2-minute Trick window, as long as the optimal amount of abilities are within the window. Below are some examples demonstrating the order I recommend.</p>
<p>This example utilizes <strong>Mug</strong> and requires the ability to double-weave. This is my suggested order of GCDs: <strong>Hyosho -> Raiton -> Fleeting -> TCJ -> Fleeting -> Raiton</strong>. Then utilize the available weave slots. Recall that after a Ninjutsu, you can only single weave, and after a standard GCD, you can only double weave (with good ping):</p>
<p>
<div class=md__image>
<img id="[397 355 51 30 360 71]" src=/img/jobs/nin/even_1.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt>
</div>
</p>
<p>This example is much like the first, however, Trick is used in the early weave slot and opens up the weave slot directly after it for Bhavacakra. Ideally if the option is available and you can double-weave, this is recommended. The drawback is, because we opened up a weave slot at the start of the window, the weave slot after the final Raiton will not be within Trick.</p>
<p>
<div class=md__image>
<img id="[283 379 312 68 71 429]" src=/img/jobs/nin/even_2.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt>
</div>
</p>
<p>The next example does NOT use <strong>Mug</strong> within Trick, and only ever single weaves. I also assume we have entered Trick at 90-95 Ninki here, allowing us to get three Bhavacakras within the window:</p>
<p>
<div class=md__image>
<img id="[347 10 91 275 227 339]" src=/img/jobs/nin/even_3.png onclick=openModal(this.id) alt>
</div>
</p>
<p>This last example is if we enter Trick at 100 Ninki and are able to fit four Bhavacakras under Trick. Fitting x4 Bhavacakras under Trick is also possible at 90-95 Ninki, but requires swapping out a Raiju for an Aeolian Edge (only if available):</p>

</p>
<h2 id=miscellaneous>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3 id=downtime>Downtime</h3>
<p>Handling downtime is rather simple on Ninja. Our filler rotation being flexible means that there is very little for us to do in terms of preparing for a segment where the boss is untargetable. Unless the downtime happens right before or during Trick, Ninja does well in handling downtime because our cooldowns will continue to tick down. This is why we do so well in fights with downtime; examples include E6S, E11S and E12S Phase Two.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If we are to overcap mudra during downtime, use a Ninjutsu before the boss goes untargetable to avoid overcapping.</li>
<li>Since preparing a Ninjutsu takes time (One to two seconds), we can prepare a Ninjutsu during downtime and promptly use it when the boss is targetable again. Such as, if Trick is to be ready within 20s, we can Suiton or otherwise possibly use Raiton. By doing this, we may gain a GCD in the post-downtime phase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some fights (P2S notably) may have downtime that happens mid-Trick. Your options are to use Trick before or after the downtime segment. The decision comes down to two factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Will holding lose you a usage by the end of the fight?</li>
<li>Will you remain aligned with the party for the rest of the fight if you held or did not hold?</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately the decision may not always be clear. Trick remaining aligned is crucial, but losing an entire usage of your cooldowns is also a huge loss. Ideally you remain aligned and don’t lose a usage of cooldowns, or you remain aligned and have used Trick pre-downtime to gain a usage by the end.</p>
<h3 id=reopeners>Reopeners</h3>
<p>How a reopener may look is fight and kill time dependent. but for the most part we can expect to use Trick on the reopener within two to three GCDs. Below are some examples of generic reopeners for reference. Pot may be weaved alone in any open weave slot.</p>
<h4 id=100-ninki--bunshin--2nd-gcd>100 Ninki + Bunshin + 2nd GCD</h4>
<p>

</div>
</p>
<p>Cooldowns may be available at different times or pot may be present as well. Above examples are just for reference and may not be applicable for certain fights.</p>
<h3 id=holding-trick>Holding Trick</h3>
<p>There may be situations where we may have to hold Trick Attack, along with our cooldowns, due to a mechanic, alignment, or a boss phasing. For the most part, we will try to keep Trick Attack strictly off cooldown to maximize our cooldown usages - especially if we do not know when we will be killing the boss.</p>
<p>However, there are plenty of cases where we can’t or should not use Trick off cooldown. Such as a downtime phase that would cut our burst off prematurely, or if holding otherwise wouldn’t result in us losing a Trick Attack and its cooldowns later in the fight.</p>
<p>If you choose to hold Trick Attack, it is important to know that doing so will overcap your Mudra stacks if an additional Ninjutsu (aside from Suiton) is not used outside of Trick Attack. Even if using a Raiton outside of Trick means one less Raiton + Raiju outside of Trick for the rest of the fight, overcapping is the potential loss of one Raiton + Raiju.</p>
<h2 id=improvement>Improvement</h2>
<h3 id=keep-your-gcd-rolling>Keep Your GCD Rolling</h3>
<p>An important note for all job classes, it is crucial that a player always keeps their GCD rolling to maximize their damage. To put simply, if you’re able to press a Global Cooldown (GCD) and aren’t, then you’re not keeping your GCD rolling. Every moment your GCD is not rolling is damage that you’re losing out on by the end of the fight. Hitting something is usually better than hitting nothing at all.</p>
<p>As melee, we may need to disconnect from the boss. While we have a ranged GCD - Throwing Dagger - we still should try to avoid it. If the disconnect happens 45s after Bunshin, we simply adjust where we use Phantom Kamaitachi. The disengagement priority can be found in the Boss Disengagement section below.</p>
<p>Positionals follow the same logic. It is better to use a GCD without hitting the positional requirement than it is to clip and hit a GCD with the positional requirement. Or if you’re at the flank of the boss, and need to hit Aeolian Edge next, simply using Armor Crush and overcapping your Huton is better than missing the Aeolian Edge positional.</p>
<h3 id=use-your-cooldowns>Use Your Cooldowns</h3>
<p>A common mistake amongst new Ninjas is severely drifting oGCDs such as Trick Attack, Bunshin, Dream Within A Dream, etc. Unless you know that drifting or moving a cooldown won’t cost you a use or are expecting a certain killtime, then don’t do it. Due to the high-burst nature of the job, we’re reliant on our oGCDs and fitting damage into burst. Drifting your cooldowns may force you to lose a use, or have your damage fall out of Trick Attack and/or other raid buffs. Every lost use of a cooldown or burst ability drifted out of buffs causes a significant loss to your personal damage.</p>
<h3 id=what-if-my-cooldowns-become-misaligned-from-trick>What if my cooldowns become misaligned from Trick?</h3>
<p>This can often happen when a boss has downtime, and our one minute cooldowns become desynced from our two minute cooldowns. This can cause Ten-Chi-Jin, for example, to come off cooldown outside of a Trick Window.</p>
<p>Unless you know your killtime, it is better to use a misaligned ability on cooldown, even if that forces the ability permanently out of Trick. The loss of losing a cooldown (especially one like Ten-Chi-Jin) far outweighs the potential gain of realigning it back with Trick Attack.</p>
<h3 id=overcapping-resources>Overcapping Resources</h3>
<p>Like most jobs, Ninja’s damage primarily comes from its cooldowns and its resources. Overcapping is the idea of losing value within a gauge, a timer, or even stacked cooldowns - due to capping it to its max value.</p>
<ol>
<li>Never overcap on Ninki, our resource gauge. Always use Bhavacakra to burn Ninki before hitting this point, even if it’s before Trick Attack.</li>
<li>Overcapping Huton loses time on your Huton timer, which will force the player to potentially use Armor Crush more than they need to. Since Armor Crush does less than Aeolian Edge, overcapping is potential damage loss.</li>
<li>Don’t overcap on Mudra stacks. Stacking to two mudra stacks is potential Raiton loss, which is a damage loss.</li>
<li>Don’t overcap on Raiju Ready stacks, as our maximum is three.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=boss-disengagement>Boss Disengagement</h3>
<p>As one of the most flexible melee in terms of disconnecting from the boss, Ninja has a wide array of options to pick from to keep their GCD rolling. Below is a simple priority list to follow to handle your disconnect:</p>
<ol>
<li>If Trick is to be off cooldown in 20s, use Suiton to disengage.</li>
<li>If the disengage is within 45s after using Bunshin, save Phantom Kamaitachi to keep your GCD rolling.</li>
<li>Use Raiton, even if that means one Raiton less in Trick.</li>
<li>Throwing Dagger</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=faq>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Why does our BiS not follow the stat priority?</strong></p>
<p>Because of stat tiering, and how it works together with our rotation, our rotation sim brought this exact combination of materia out to be a higher average DPS value than fully going with our stat priority. If you want to know more about the math behind stats and stat tiering, go to the sub stats tier list up above by the spreadsheets.</p>
<p><strong>How much ping do I need to double-weave?</strong></p>
<p>The threshold is around ~40ms.</p>
<p><strong>Should I always weave Trick late?</strong></p>
<p>Only purposely weave Trick late in the opener. Anywhere else, use off cooldown.</p>
<p><strong>Should I save Bunshin for Trick, or use it on cooldown?</strong></p>
<p>Use on cooldown.</p>
<p><strong>Should I use Phantom Kamaitachi immediately or save it for Trick Attack?</strong></p>
<p>First priority of Phantom Kamaitachi is to use it as a disengagement tool over Raiton or Throwing Dagger. If there is none, you generally can save it for the next Trick window. Some important things to keep in mind:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Odd Trick Windows (no-TCJ): Most of the time prefer Phantom.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>. Even/2m Trick Windows (with TCJ): Generally, you do not want Phantom in 2m windows.</p>
<p><strong>Should I be using Forked Raiju or Fleeting Raiju?</strong></p>
<p>Both Forked Raiju and Fleeting Raiju have an identical potency of 560. Forked Raiju is a gapcloser, whereas Fleeting Raiju is a standard melee GCD which allows it freedom of movement. Realistically you should always be using Fleeting Raiju, however if you need to use a gapcloser then use Forked Raiju.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: use whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>Does Kassatsu damage percent affect Hyosho and Goka?</strong></p>
<p>Yes it does.</p>
