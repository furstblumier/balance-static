<strong>Spinning Edge</strong></p>
<p>Delivers an attack with a potency of 230. Grants 5 Ninki. This is the first part of our basic combo.</p>
<p><img src=https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000602_hr1.png alt=GustSlash><br>
<strong>Gust Slash</strong></p>
<p>Delivers an attack with a potency of 100. If used after Spinning Edge in the combo, it will instead deliver an attack with a potency of 340. Grants 5 Ninki if used in combo. This is the second part of our basic combo.</p>
<p><img src=https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000605_hr1.png alt=AeolianEdge><br>
<strong>Aeolian Edge</strong></p>
<p>Delivers an attack with a potency of 100, 160 potency if done from the rear of the enemy. If this is used after Gust Slash as the third part of our combo, it will instead deliver an attack with a potency of 420, 480 if done from the rear of the enemy. Grants 10 Ninki if used in combo. This is one of two options for the third part of our basic combo.</p>
<p><img src=https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002915_hr1.png alt=ArmorCrush><br>
<strong>Armor Crush</strong></p>
<p>Delivers an attack with a potency of 100, 160 if done from the flank of the enemy. If this is used after Gust Slash as the third part of the combo, it will instead deliver an attack with a potency of 400, 460 if done from the flank of the enemy. If done as part of the combo, it will also add 30 seconds to your Huton timer, assuming your Huton timer is already going, to a maximum of 70 seconds. Grants 10 Ninki if used in combo.

<strong>Shadow Fang</strong></p>
<p>Delivers an attack with a potency of 200. In addition, this will also put a damage over time effect (DoT) that lasts 30 seconds and deals a potency of 90 every tick, resulting in this ability having a total potency of 1100 when all of the DoT ticks are accounted for. Unlike other GCDs for ninja, this GCD has an extra personal cooldown of 70 seconds, though this is reduced by skill speed and Huton, which will make it have just under a 60 second cooldown once you have Huton up. Grants 10 Ninki.</p>
<p><img src=https://xivapi.com/i/000000/000614_hr1.png alt=ThrowingDagger><br>
<strong>Throwing Dagger</strong></p>

<p>Delivers an attack with a potency of 100 to all nearby enemies. If done as the second part of our AoE combo, it instead delivers an attack with a potency of 140 to all nearby enemies, as well as adds ten seconds to your Huton timer assuming your Huton timer is already going. Just like Death Blossom, this is an AoE attack that deals damage in a five yalm radius around you. Grants 5 Ninki if used in combo.</p>
<h2 id=ninjutsusmudras>Ninjutsus/Mudras</h2>
<p>Ninjutsus set off a global cooldown of 1.5 seconds upon use, not reducible by Huton or skill speed, and each use of a ninjutsu will use up one mudra charge. Mudras have a shared 2 charges, which are used by using a ninjutsu, a charge time of 20 seconds per charge, and can only be started when a normal GCD could be started. Instead of a 2.5 or 1.5 second global cooldown, the mudras themselves only give a .5 second global cooldown.</p>

<p><img src=https://xivapi.com/i/002000/002911_hr1.png alt=Doton><br>
<strong>Doton</strong></p>
<p>Creates a patch of corrupted earth that acts like a stationary DoT that does 100 potency to enemies who are in it when it ticks for damage and 100 potency to anyone in the AoE as it is created.
