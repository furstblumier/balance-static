Welcome to the encounter guide for the first tier of Endwalker.
We will review the different ways on what is possible to optimize from the entirety of the tier.
Erichtonios Nothing much to say, this is a dummy fight; do the optimal drift rotation for max damage.
Make sure you and the group are as central as possible during Intemperance 1 and Intemperance 2 to ensure you’re going to hit everyone.</description></item><item><title>Monk Skills Overview</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/skills-overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 12:19:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/skills-overview/</guid><description>Single Target GCDs Monk has six core single-target GCDs:
Bootshine has a potency of 210, or 310 when you have Leaden Fist. When in Opo-Opo form, Bootshine will always crit. Dragon Kick has a potency of 320. When in Opo-Opo form, it will grant the Leaden Fist buff. True Strike has a potency of 300.</description></item><item><title>Monk Openers</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/openers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 11:38:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/openers/</guid><description>Openers Lunar Solar Double Solar Early Lunar Solar Early Double Solar Other Resources Video Guide: Monk Openers Explained

More than eight years in the making, and Intern-kun has finally decided that enough is enough; he&amp;rsquo;s going to intentionally change Monk gameplay in the 6.0 expansion. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long road &amp;ndash; from a series of accidents birthing TK gameplay, to Anatman encouraging Monks everywhere to equip their Fisher job stones &amp;ndash; but this is the expansion where, in theory, the rotational changes are going to be calculated, deliberate, and above all hold no emergent gameplay value resulting from a severe lack of foresight and/or understanding of how the game works&amp;hellip;.</description></item><item><title>Monk FAQ</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/faq/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 11:17:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/faq/</guid><description>Is Double True Strike dead?
As purely the best option, yup, go back to 1:1 Twin Snakes and True.
What&amp;rsquo;s with the double Dragon Kick in the openers?
With Standard, you DK after Perfect Balance for DK&amp;rsquo;s higher potency and again later to gain Leaden finally. With Early Buff a stanceless Leaden Boot after PB is worse on average than using the DK to guarantee a crit one.</description></item><item><title>Monk Advanced Guide</title><link>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/advanced-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 21:07:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/jobs/melee/monk/advanced-guide/</guid><description>Oops, we don&amp;rsquo;t have that guide yet!
